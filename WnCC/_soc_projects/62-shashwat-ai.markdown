Reinforcement Learning has hit headlines globally due to recent breakthroughs like AlphaGo and Google's DeepMind initiative. Many recent AI agents have outstripped human players by a huge margin in many computer games.
The aim of this project is to build, code and observe the behaviour of such AI agents in the OpenAI Universe environment.
