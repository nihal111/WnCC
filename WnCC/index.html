					<h2>What is the Web and Coding Club?</h2>
					<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="{{ '/images/wncc.jpg' | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="" /></a>
					<p>Web and Coding Club is one of the biggest clubs of IIT Bombay. As a part of the Students' Technical Activities Body, we aim to provide a gateway for the people in our institute to join the coding community. We create a platform which allows students to gain assistance and mentorship to enhance their coding ability. Our aim is to propagate the enthusiasm for coding in the institute and especially amongst freshmen. We believe that every student here at IITB should have an opportunity to learn how to code and develop a passion for it. The secret of getting ahead is getting started and we aim to provide every student with the right start.
