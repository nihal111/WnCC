We're creating an interactive textbook for exposition of probability and statistics. The idea is to motivate the concepts and allow consumers to interact with various parts of the exposition for a better subject understanding. 

<!--break-->

You can get a feel of what we're trying to do by looking at [this](http://students.brown.edu/seeing-theory). **Task:** You will be required to create interactive models for visualizing various concepts. We plan to use the  D3.js library for this (https://d3js.org/). People with experience in D3.js or generic Javascript are preferred.

### Week 1
* Learnt JavaScript.
* Learnt CSS. 
* Prepared a working model of coin-flips.

### Week 2
* Added a dynamic bar graph.
* Started on Conditional Probability. 
* Learned D3 js and bootstrap.

### Week 3
* Completion of the coin-flips model

### Week 4
* Conditional Probability model to near completion with minor edits to be made.
