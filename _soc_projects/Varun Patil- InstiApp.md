InstiApp is a WnCC initiative to create a unified platform for everything that happens inside IIT Bombay. The chief component of this is events, which aims for students being kept updated with talks, competitions and even informal events happening inside the institute. The broad aim is not only to reduce dependence on social media and word of mouth, but to make this a one-stop solution for all informative, as well as promotional needs.

This project will focus on development of the backend of the app, which is a RESTful API in Django, and the frontend development, which consists of developing an Android App and a Progressive Web Application will take place separately in parallel, though there might inevitably be some overlap.
This project enforces very strict coding standards and testing routines, so you will essentially learn not only Python and Django, but Software Development the way it is supposed to be done. If you are not already familiar with these, you will also learn what REST is, how APIs function, writing tests and ensuring code coverage, what are the security issues and how they are fixed, authorization and authentication in a highly complex permissions model, working with relational databases, search engine optimization, continuous integration and delivery (DevOps) and so on.

Development has already started and basic functionality including events, institute bodies, authorization, placement and training blogs etc. is implemented, so you can skip the boring framework parts and directly jump to really developing something interesting.

Current state of development:
* The app in its current stage is deployed at [IITB Gymkhana](https://gymkhana.iitb.ac.in/instiapp/) and a [staging server](https://evenire.radialapps.com). You can also explore the API at the [backend staging server](https://temp-iitb.radialapps.com).
* The backend repository can be found at [GitHub wncc/IITBapp](https://github.com/wncc/IITBapp) 
* The Android App is under development at [wncc/IITB-App](https://github.com/wncc/IITB-app)
* The Web Application is under development at [pulsejet/iitb-app-angular](https://github.com/pulsejet/iitb-app-angular) 

You can get a broad idea of what you will be working on by browsing the [current and past issues]( https://github.com/wncc/IITBapp/issues) at GitHub.

More specifically, you will engage in the following:
* Implementation of the much-wanted mess menu feature
* Development of a news feed, which will aggregate and display news from various institute bodies.
* Implementation of event tagging
* Implementing the backend for the map view
* Improving the heuristic used for prioritizing events for users
* Creating the backend for push notifications (Firebase Cloud Messaging)
* Promotional and featured events
* Expanding the existing API further
* Bug hunting and fixing
* More features, which are too many to list here
* Further ideation
