#### The task is to convert English to code and convert code back into English

### Statistical Modelling of Star Maps

#### The idea here is to convert English to code and convert code back into English. A number of use cases can be possible here, automatic generation of test code, comments, docstrings, or maybe more efficient ways to write code / code review.

#### My goal is to somehow use signals from a compiler (as reinforcement learning rewards / or loss function terms) to assist this modelling.

#### Here are some recent papers trying to model this.
