Each one of us must have used the Cam-scanner app on Android phones for quick and good quality scanning of documents. But what if you have to scan a really big document? Or maybe you want to capture more detail?

<!--break-->

We will be looking at ways to capture multiple images of sections of a single document and "stitching" them together to get a scan-quality image, using methods very similar to those used for capturing panorama images. Though it is more fun to experiment with the algorithms using test images, at the end of the project one can hope for an Android app which implements this stitching in real time.
