Learn to Flap is a machine learning project to use supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms to build an AI that plays the game "Flappy Bird". We plan to start with using supervised learning algorithms by using Support Vector Classifier, Neural Networks, and also use unsupervised methods like Q-learning.

<!--break-->

We may also work on other variations of the game if time permits.
Reading material would include some book on machine learning to get the basics and some work that has been done by other people (will provide them as the project progresses). A student is expected to have interest in machine learning and AI (coding experience isn't necessary).
