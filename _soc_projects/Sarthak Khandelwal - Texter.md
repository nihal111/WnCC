"Texter is something my team developed for the Microsoft Code Fun Do hackathon. Texter takes a piece of boring text, mostly educational and inserts relevant images in between to make the reading interesting. This project serves as an educational aid to the blind. There are 3 deliverables:

1 Chrome Extension: which when activated scans the current webpage for all the texts and downloads all the relevant pictures and display it.
2 Android App: The app takes some text as input and inserts relevant images in between that text.
3 Python Script: This python script compiles the text, images, downloads audio and compiles it into a video. 

The main aim of this Seasons Of Code project would be to analyse the images the API sends and check if those images have text. This images serves as an aid to blind, so it wouldn't make any sense if those images have text. So a model needs to be developed which checks for texts in these images and rejects them.

Tentative Timeline:
Week 1: Get familiar with the project, the APIs used and what the project structure is
Week 2: Switch everything from Azure APIs to Google APIs and run the project
Week 3: Learn the basic concepts of Image Processing 
Week 4: Implement images processing to detect text
Week 5: Improve the chrome extension such that it inserts images in between web pages as well
Week 6: Test everything and tinker about future improvements. "
