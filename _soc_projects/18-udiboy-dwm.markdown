Building and Setting up dwn on any OS, and creating a patch to add animation support to it.

<!--break-->
### Animations in dwm
[dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org/) or Dynamic Window Manager is an extremely lightweight window manager (25KB of source code). It has no external configuration and only believes in configuring the source code (using C header) directly. The project would involve understanding X window management using dwm, building and setting up dwm on any OS (Arch or Void preferably) and creating a patch to add animation support to it.
