Learn and practice algorithms and data structures needed for competitive programming contests. The project will involve learning the important algorithms/data structures in the field of Computer Science on your own (I will provide the reference material) and then practice lots and lots of problems on competitive coding websites like [www.spoj.com](www.spoj.com), [www.codeforces.com](www.codeforces.com).

In your proposal mention your familiarity with C++

Reading material: There is humongous collection of tutorials, videos, practice problems on the internet. Google them.
