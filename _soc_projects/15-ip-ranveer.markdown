We are developing an image processing ensemble which implements various IP algorithms for use in academics and applications. We plan on building open APIs, so that apps can be built out of these mini-applications.

What's cool about this project? You can work on anything! Your own idea, a half implemented idea, anything. Over time, we identify common functions and integrate them in the core engine to be used by other applications. Currently, we are working on changing real life objects into cartoons, solving mazes and face swap.
