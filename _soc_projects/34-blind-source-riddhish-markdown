Blind Source Separation refers to the type of problems a mixture of a known number or signals is given, and the sources need to be resolved. Implementation include separating blended images, or audio samples *(the famous cocktail party problem)*. The project involves exploring various implementations of Independent Component Analysis on sound/images and demonstrating through an ipython notebook.
