Get started with Machine Learning!

<!--break-->

This project aims to teach basic machine learning using Kaggle competetions as a means. It will be tremendously helpful for one to learn modelling and especially cross validation. It will help you to learn all sort of modelling approaches and will forces you to think critically in the domain of data science.

This project will be very rewarding as you will find yourself open to a vast material of research upon grasping the basics. Implementation will be very useful for an indepth understanding.

Basic Programming skills is a prerequisite.
The following points are a plus:
1) Background in ML/DL (include your previous projects)
2) Experience with Python
