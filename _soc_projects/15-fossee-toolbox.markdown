The FOSSEE group has developed various toolboxes in Scilab to match Matlabâ€™s functionalities. The interns will have to develop functions, provide documentation and test existing functions. Interns from any background can apply. For each toolbox, domain expertise in terms of projects and courses is expected.

<!--break-->

We have internship positions for the following toolboxes:

| Toolbox                          | Requirements                                             |
| :------------------------------: | :------------------------------------------------------: |
| **Signal Processing / DSP**          | Advanced knowledge of concepts and technical terms involved in [Signal Processing](https://in.mathworks.com/help/signal/functionlist.html) and [DSP](https://in.mathworks.com/help/dsp/functionlist.html). Matlab/Scilab coding experience is required.|
| **Image Processing & Computer Vision** | Advanced level knowledge of concepts and technical terms involed in [Image Processing](https://in.mathworks.com/help/images/functionlist.html) and [Computer Vision](https://in.mathworks.com/help/vision/functionlist.html). Experience calling OpenCV/PCL functions in C/C++ code is required.|
| **Communication Systems** | Advanced level knowledge of concepts and technical terms involved in [Communication Systems](https://in.mathworks.com/help/comm/functionlist.html). Matlab/Scilab coding experience is required. |
| **Optimization** | Knowledge of optimization concepts is expected. C/C++ coding experience is required. |

### Applicants for image processing, computer vision and optimization toolboxes should:
1. Have excellent coding skills in C and C++
2. Know how to call functions from external libraries in C/C++ code
3. Know how to compile C/C++ code by linking against external libraries

### Application Procedure:
1. Applicants should attempt the coding test for the various toolboxes that will be put up [here](http://fossee.in/internship) on May 1, 2017. Submission steps and deadline will be mentioned in the problem statement for each toolbox. No reminder regarding the test or submission deadline will be sent.
2. No project proposal is required for this project.
