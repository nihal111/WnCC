Despite many recent groundbreaking advances in pattern recognition and image recognition, most of which are attributable to Machine Learning methods like Convolutional Neural Networks, these algorithms face multiple problems like a [lack of robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.1897) with respect to scale, lighting, rotation, noise etc.

[Scale Invariant Feature Transform](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Scale-invariant_feature_transform) is a method of object/feature detection that excels in this regard. Applications include recognition under occlusion, panoramic image stitching, apps like CamScanner and much more.
