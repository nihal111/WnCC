### Virtual Keyboard
The project is about making a virtual keyboard that can be projected on any flat surface like a table and then can be used to type in real-time. To start with, we need to program image processing that senses touch at a certain key on the virtual setting of keyboard. after that we need to fetch programs for individual as well as combination of keys (ex. Shift + any letter = Capital).
