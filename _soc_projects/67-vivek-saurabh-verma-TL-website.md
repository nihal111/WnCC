Develop a Django website for Tinkerers’ Laboratory


We are working to add on certain features to the pre-existing Tinkerers’ Laboratory website to incorporate it with a new setup for entry recording, issuing items from the lab, and access to machines using biometric data.

<!--break-->

This website needs to be capable to dynamically update to display inventory currently in the lab and people should be able flag errors/discrepancies which would them generate automatic notifications to alert the TL team. Additionally, machine availability and maintenance requests are to be made public.

No pre-requisites required.
