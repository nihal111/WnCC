A Scratch workshop was held on 5th and 6th of August as we celebrated Scratch Day, followed by a 24hr freshie competition at game making! The basics of game making and animations were taught Saturday morning before the battle began in groups of two. After a gruelling day, the students submitted really awesome projects. The results of the Scratch Game Malking Competition are:
<ol>
