This talk was based on the blog post written by Aman Goel- https://medium.com/@amangoeliitb/build-a-solid-career-in-tech-without-a-cs-major-39cdef86013#.nmx11184b which was widely read. Sumith Kulal also accompanied him to pitch in a few facts about the Google Summer of Code program.
The overall agenda was to get a roadmap to prepare for tech internships and jobs.
