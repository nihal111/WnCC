<p>Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to create a mobile application with which you can click any sudoku from the camera and fill it with the correct solution, giving you the power to spoil the fun of your sudoku solving friends.</p>

<!--break-->

<p>Later, you will be able to easily extend the project to other games as well.
There will be four modules that need to be completed.
1) Given a graph, solve the sudoku puzzle in the backend.
2) Given an image, which is taken with proper alignment, extract the graph using various image processing and possibly ML techniques, that will be fed to the solver.
3) Now extend the previous module to get the graph with general images which need not be well aligned
4) Develop an Android app.
5) Try your own extensions to the project like for a new game by abstracting the framework you developed</p>
