In just a few seconds we can tell whether weâ€™re listening to Classical music, Rap, Blues or EDM. However, this task is one which computers have historically havenâ€™t been able to solve well. We aim to develop a machine learning algorithm which automatically classifies a song into its correct genre.</h4>
