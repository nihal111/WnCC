<p>This project tries to explore navigation using Geolocation AR.</p>

<!--break-->

<p>Problem Statement : Remember Pokemon GO? How about doing something similar but more useful? How about moving around with smartphones in hand looking around Augmented World. Geo-location AR has huge potential in navigation and assistance.</p>
