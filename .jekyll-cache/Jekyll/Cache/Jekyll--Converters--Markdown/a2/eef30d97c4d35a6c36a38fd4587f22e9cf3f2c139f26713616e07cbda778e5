<p>“This is more of a long time pet project, which I feel I now have some idea on how to solve. The task is to identify all constellations in images of the sky. On a superficial level, this is an image to image conversion problem. But the task is a lot simpler since we simply need to draw particular lines on an image to form a connect graph.</p>

<p>As a first task, we can train a model which searches for a particular constellation. As the second, more challenging task, we attempt to identify all constellations in the image.</p>

<p>While I am more keen on using graphical models here, CNNs might simplify the work tremendously.”</p>
